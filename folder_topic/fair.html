<p>What is FAIR?
FAIR is an acronym that stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. FAIR is not a standard itself but a set of guiding principles designed to create standards and best practices on improving the management, sharing, and reuse of data. It is particularly important in scientific research and data-intensive fields. The FAIR principles aim to improve data quality, usability, longevity, and therefore can be effectively utilized by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Findable
Objective: Make data easy to find for both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Key Aspects:</p>
<p>Data should have a unique identifier (e.g., a DOI or persistent URL).</p>
<p>Metadata (information about the data) should be rich enough to support discovery.</p>
<p>The data and metadata should be stored in a searchable resource.</p>
<p>Accessible
Objective: Ensure that once data is found, it can be accessed in a standardized, secure and authorized manner.</p>
<p>Key Aspects:</p>
<p>Data should be retrievable by its identifier using a standardized protocol (e.g., HTTP).</p>
<p>Access protocols should be open and free whenever possible, but authentication and authorization procedures may be applied whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Metadata should remain accessible even if the data itself is restricted or no longer available.</p>
<p>Interoperable
Objective: Enable data to be combined and used with other data across different systems.</p>
<p>Key Aspects:</p>
<p>Data should use standardized/common formats, languages, and vocabularies to ensure compatibility with other data and systems.</p>
<p>Data and metadata should follow community standards and use controlled vocabularies, ontologies, and taxonomies to support integration and analysis.</p>
<p>Data should be linked across different sources whenever possible.</p>
<p>Reusable
Objective: Ensure that data can be reused for future research and applications.</p>
<p>Key Aspects:</p>
<p>Data should be well-documented with clear licensing and usage terms.</p>
<p>Metadata should include information about the data’s provenance (e.g., who created it, under what conditions, and any changes made).</p>
<p>Data should be structured in a way that supports its reuse across various contexts, including any ethical and legal constraint.</p>
<p>Why is it important to apply the principles of FAIR to our scientific work here at DTU Biosustain?
Enhances Collaboration: FAIR data facilitates collaboration among researchers across institutions and disciplines. Ask yourself this: wouldn’t it be super if you know active data (not yet public) produced within the center that are relevant and beneficial to your own projects?</p>
<p>Increases Impact: By ensuring data can be easily found and reused, FAIR principles maximize the impact of research and data investments. Researcher could simply expect more acknowledgement (e.g. citations) of their research output.</p>
<p>Improves Reproducibility: FAIR principles naturally come with the benefit of making data more reproducible and transparent. This not only help your fellow researchers but also to your(future)self.</p>
<p>What are the challenges of making general rules for people here at DTU Biosustain to implement FAIR?
Diverse Research Practices and Data Types: Research in our center is very diverse which makes data types, methodologies and standards harder to interoperate. This results in major challenges to make general rules that cover all research disciplines. Different research groups may use incompatible software, data formats, or vocabularies, making it hard to integrate data across projects.</p>
<p>Balancing Flexibility with Standardization: While the FAIR principles advocate for standardized practices, researchers often require flexibility to adapt data management practices to their specific needs and the evolving nature of their work. A rigid rule may not accommodate the unique data-sharing needs of a project that involves sensitive (e.g. GDPR) and/or intellectual property rights (IPR) data. The latter case is especially evident in the numerous industry-applied projects conducted at our center.</p>
<p>Cultural and Behavioral Change: Researchers may be resistant to change, particularly if new FAIR-compliant practices require more time or disrupt established workflows. Researchers who are used to managing data in a way that is convenient for them may resist the additional effort required to make data more findable and reusable by others (e.g. generate comprehensive, thorough metadata and documentation).</p>
<p>Lack of Incentives: Researchers may lack incentives to invest in data management practices that align with FAIR principles, especially if these practices don’t directly contribute to their primary research outputs. Publishing papers may be prioritized over creating reusable data sets, especially when data management efforts are not recognized in academic evaluations.</p>
<p>Evolving Standards and Technologies: Data management standards and technologies evolve, and keeping up with these changes while maintaining FAIR practices can be difficult. We may implement a data standard that later becomes obsolete, requiring further adjustments to maintain FAIR compliance. In Denmark, national strategy for FAIR research data management is a continuous effort and will likely change over time.</p>
<p>How may we address these challenges?
Training and Support: We have been providing ongoing training and support can help researchers understand and implement FAIR principles more effectively. We are planning to ramp up this effort in both frequency and diversity to cover more subjects and reach out to more researchers. These include crafting and improving useful FAIR data tools such as LIMS extensions and Data Catalog, building automatic data capture, process and analytics pipelines, hosting and implementing data upskilling educations such as Azure Fundamentals, Pipeline management NextFlow and CodeRefinery workshop.</p>
<p>Tailored FAIRness solutions: Current implementation of informatics platform infrastructure aims to maximize the fit for needs of center’s major research data types including genomics (DNA/RNA), metabolomics and proteomics. This is a long-term and continuous effort to build customized solutions that fulfil both FAIRness requirements and research value.</p>
<p>Incentivization: We created FAIR award to researchers and teams who dedicated their tremendous efforts in making data FAIRer every year. We will continue develop program and campaign to demonstrate and showcase the benefits applying FAIR principles.</p>
<p>Building Collaboration and Community: We have set up data ambassador program for this very purpose. Leveraging the Informatics Platform infrastructure, we aim to drive the creation of actionable goals, enhance knowledge sharing, and promote effective data stewardship. We will also monitor and adapt our data strategy as needed. Our ultimate goal is to cultivate an environment at DTU Biosustain where everyone contributes to making data FAIRer and maximizing its value.</p>
